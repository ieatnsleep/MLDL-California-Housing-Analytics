# MLDL-California-Housing-Analytics

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project is a comprehensive analysis and prediction of housing prices in California using both traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project leverages the California Housing dataset, which is a popular benchmark for regression tasks. This project demonstrates my proficiency in data science, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation and evaluation of various predictive models.

Skills Demonstrated

### Data Preprocessing & Exploration
Data cleaniing by standardizing features, capped extreme values to manage outliers. Generated histograms to understand the dataset distrbutions.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualized the geospatial distribution of median house values, conducted correlation analysis between median house values and median income.

### Predictive modelling
Implementing various machine learning and deep learning models with various algorithms

### Data visualization
Using bar chart to perform comparative analysis, line graph for visualization of validation loss over epochs during deep learning implementation, and scatter plot with linear regression lines to visulize the peformance of the model to the data.
